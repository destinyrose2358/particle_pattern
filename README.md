This is a generating program that gives out files containing terms to the bouncing particle sequence

in this idea, you have a ray of infinitely many points that can only move along that ray.
the first point is moved infinitely far, and each point after moves forward
the same distance that the previous points had moved to get to that points starting position.

eg:

*---------->
 *-
  *---
   *----
